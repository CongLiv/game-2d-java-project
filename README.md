# 2D ADVENTURE GAME - JAVA GAME

<h2>MAZE DUNGEON</h2>
<p>This is my first Java game project. The project is part of the Java project competition - "Java Project" of the Programming Department - NEU Information Technology Club - NITC.</p>

<h3>Game mechanic</h3><p>
- The player has a healing time and an attack cooldown.<p>
- Entities in the game (both player and monsters) have a damage blocking rate.<p>
- Monsters will be randomly spawned on each map, depending on their difficulty level.<p>
- I used the A* pathfinding algorithm so that the monsters could chase the player.<p>

<h3>Tech and credit</h3><p>
- Only use Java Swing.<p>
- Thanks for 2D game tutorial on RyiSnow Youtube channel!<p>
- In-game graphics are collected from many free graphic pack on the internet.<p>
